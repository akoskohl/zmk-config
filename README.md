# Building a (wireless) corne
Building a corne keyboard involves assembling the fundamental components that make up a functional keyboard. </br>
This repo is a basic guide how I did it, and contains the files for my zmk keymap. </br>

## What you need to buy
</br>✅ PCB (Printed Circuit Board): This is the brain of the keyboard, connecting the switches and managing keypress signals.
</br>✅ Switches: Choose mechanical switches based on your preference (Cherry MX, Gateron, etc.). These are the keys that register keypresses.
</br>✅ Keycaps: These are the physical keys you press. Make sure they are compatible with your chosen switches.
</br>⌛ Microcontroller: As my goal was to go wireless, currently the only option is the nicenano chip. Order how swap sockets as well.
</br>✅Diodes: Solder diodes to prevent key ghosting and ensure accurate input.
</br>✅Plate: A plate can be used to hold switches in place and provide stability.
</br>✅Case: Plenty of options, currently just a plate, but later I would like to have a 3D printed one.
</br>✅ave 1U keys, not needed for his build.
</br>✅Soldering Iron and Solder: For soldering switches and other components to the PCB.
</br>⌛ Layout design: You can program any keystroke anywhere as you want to.
</br>⌛ Battery: To be truly wireless.
</br>

## Base steps

⌛ Layout Planning: Decide on your keyboard layout and ensure all components are compatible.
</br>⬜ Soldering: Solder the diodes to the PCB, followed by the switches. Make sure to solder carefully and avoid cold joints.
</br>⬜ Attach Microcontroller: Connect the microcontroller to the PCB, ensuring it has the necessary firmware.
</br>⬜ Programming: Program your microcontroller to recognize keypresses and assign functions to each key.
</br>⬜ Assembling the Case: Place the PCB into the case, securing it in place. If using a plate, attach switches to it before placing it in the case.
</br>⬜ Keycaps: Place keycaps on the switches, ensuring they are aligned correctly.
</br>⬜ Testing: Test each key to ensure it registers correctly. Fix any issues that arise.
</br>⬜ Final Assembly: Close the case, securing all components in place.

Currently some parts missing, so I'm waiting for that, meanwhile assembled just to see how it will look:
