# Building a (wireless) corne
Building a corne keyboard involves assembling the fundamental components that make up a functional keyboard. </br>
This repo is a basic guide how I did it, and contains the files for my zmk keymap. </br>

## What you need to buy
- [x] PCB (Printed Circuit Board): This is the brain of the keyboard, connecting the switches and managing keypress signals.
- [x] Switches: Choose mechanical switches based on your preference (Cherry MX, Gateron, etc.). These are the keys that register keypresses.
- [x] Keycaps: These are the physical keys you press. Make sure they are compatible with your chosen switches.
- [I] Microcontroller: As my goal was to go wireless, currently the only option is the nicenano chip. Order how swap sockets as well.
- [x] Diodes: Solder diodes to prevent key ghosting and ensure accurate input.
- [x] Plate: A plate can be used to hold switches in place and provide stability.
- [x] Case: Plenty of options, currently just a plate, but later I would like to have a 3D printed one.
- [x] Stabilizers: If you're building a larger keyboard or using certain key layouts, you'll need stabilizers for larger keys like Enter, Shift, and Spacebar, as I only have 1U keys, not needed for his build.
- [x] Soldering Iron and Solder: For soldering switches and other components to the PCB.
- [I] Layout design: You can program any keystroke anywhere as you want to.
- [I] Battery: To be truly wireless.
